I don't like job in general, you know it. I love helping people but doing a job is... Often it went outside of your expectation. I love coding and messing with things, but I possibly can't do that in actual job.</p><p>But that's only a possibility. I may actually score an awesome job! So let's try my best doing this in a structured manner that actually works and don't render my heart too much due to rejection.</p><h3>My State of Portfolio</h3><p>My portfolio is made of some half finished static websites that I made with with some bad security idea in mind, thus it goes unpublished. But it's fine, and displaying my markup skill a bit.</p><p>I don't have any working server right now. I think it's time to stop being stingy and start a good project with VPS. Next.js is worth it and very fine technology right now.</p><p>I haven't made the final PDF yet. I want to have a good one without hassle and portable enough, so I guess it will be Google Docs. I need it badly for applying so by the time anyone see this writing, it's already available.</p><p>My state of basic coding skill, I think I'm not a noob, but far from experienced. My skill much better than most people in <a href="https://thejsbootcamp.com/">flavio bootcamp</a> I think, or maybe I'm arrogant delusional. Of course there are some experienced programmer in flavio bootcamp that took the course to update their skill. There's actually <a href="https://github.com/dmitryt/tiny-web-server">a dude who recreated Node.js http module in TypeScript</a>. Oh man, why are you in a beginner class.</p><p>Well, I just finished with FreeCodeCamp certification so that could speak up a bit for my skill.</p><h3>Have you look up jobs?</h3><p>Jobs are everywhere, but that makes finding a good one can be harder. I think this is my current Issue. I have to make a strategy to apply efficiently and avoiding potholes.</p><p>Let's filter the job now.</p><ol><li>It should be local or has local presence. A foreign one is fine but must have solid background.</li><li>It should take a junior, 2 year experience kind.</li><li>It's not a pothole.</li><li>It aligns with my skillset and development program - backend.</li></ol><p>This is just a random list I made, but surely can be worked on as a base for specifying wanted job.</p><p>The first and second is easy to identify so I skipped on that.</p><p>Number 4, since I want to be a backend guy, my focus should be looking for a full stack dev position with node js backend or PHP which I already understand well. PHP is not very tasty now and I'm rusty, so I left out with JavaScript backend. That's quite specific.</p><p>Number 3, I don't know.</p><p>Here are some idea:</p><ol><li>Google all job and it's company, make a database and filter them properly.</li><li>It should be filtered by:<ol><li>It has actual working application</li><li>It has good presence on internet</li><li>Some people work in it Linked In</li><li>Some open source presence -- hard</li><li>It doesn't have any bad presence</li></ol></li></ol><p>Little I can do to avoid pot hole so I must pray for the best.</p><p>--- PRAYING ---</p><p>Alright, now here is the step I will take.</p><ol><li>Make a portfolio in pdf</li><li>Collect as much as information from telegram for job.</li><li>Collect them from various job listing, flavio, nocsok and one remote web job.</li><li>Tabulate the data and send!</li></ol><p>Some precaution need to be made. Number 2 and number 3 can take forever to do so limit it by hours. 2 hours at best.</p><p>Alright, now before i finish my article, I will present you <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IOS6SX04jekfDUbntQmRt1EZbHXzst4vhW0eB0zRbnk/export?format=pdf">my PDF</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSzAlfJdrYeyyCS3P4KfxTO3p2s3hUH_WazrzVm518IG12g0Ul1sZf_nYymJC-SqqNXTgWrh-Kw5RvD/pub">web version</a> of resume.</p><p>--- PRAYING ---</p><blockquote><p>One of my favorite prayer in this situation is Istikahara, you could look it up.</p></blockquote><p>Now my resume is perfect, it's time to set out for the 2nd and 3rd step.</p><p>This will be the end of my article, see you!</p></div></article></div></div></div><div class="xl:col-start-6 xl:col-span-1"></div></div></body></html>
