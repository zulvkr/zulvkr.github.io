<p><img src="/image/blog.jpg" alt="home"></p>
<p>There are several point of critics:</p>
<h3>Where is the focus?</h3>
<p>I couldn't help my self get distracted by big eye catching words and image in the left when I read the right side. The color has to be toned down to allow it to go to the background.</p>
<h3>Why so many asymmetrical empty space</h3>
<p>The asymmetry must be balanced out with other item.</p>
<h3>The Big Java is annoying</h3>
<p>It reminded me of banner that blotting the sky. It must be taken down.</p>
<h3>Why is there 2 Hi like paragraph?</h3>
<p>I have 2 paragraph which describe 1. my blog, 2. myself. Which are overwhelming.</p>
<h3>The good part</h3>
<p>I actually like how the paragraphs and each post are organized. Typographically aesthetic.</p>
<h3>A few minutes later</h3>
<p>Actually, after evaluating eiwing my own design, I feel more confident in deleting some things taht are unnecessary to the blog. It's awesome feeling you get liken when you refactor some codes. I guess I have to practice this work - stop - review workflow to get more productive.</p>
