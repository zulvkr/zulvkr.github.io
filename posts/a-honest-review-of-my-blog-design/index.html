  <div class="font-serif"><p>After a few hours of HTML editing with Tailwind at hand, I saw my blog homepage in utter disgust. Sometimes the more you did things, the more you messed up.</p>
<p><img src="/image/blog.jpg" alt="home"></p>
<p>So, I left off my chair. Prayed, and did an objective review of my own design. Here are some critics:</p>
<h3>Where is the focus?</h3>
<p>I couldn't help my self but to get distracted by the big eye catching words and image in the left when I read the right side. The color has to be toned down to allow it to go to the background. But it should be brighter in smaller screen since the fixed position only applied in large screen.</p>
<h3>Why so Many Asymmetrical Empty Space</h3>
<p>The asymmetry must be balanced out with other items. I suggests adding some balancing items. What kind? Hmm... Maybe icon to GitHub, anouncement icon, a quirky thing like possum? Mascot a bird perhaps. Animated things when you hover them. IDK.</p>
<h3>The Big Java Image is annoying</h3>
<p>It reminded me of banner that blotting the sky. It must be taken down. I woud love to show my country image in other place where it actually matters.</p>
<h3>Why are there 2 &quot;Hi&quot; paragraph?</h3>
<p>I have 2 paragraph which describe 1. my blog, 2. myself. Which are overwhelming. One to be toned down. The Java island doesn't help doesn't help either.</p>
<h3>The Good Part</h3>
<p>I actually like how the paragraphs and each post are organized, the date part is aesthetic.</p>
<h3>A few minutes later</h3>
<p>Actually, after I evaluated my own design, I felt more confident in deleting some things that are unnecessary to the blog. It feels like super power and I got an awesome feeling like when you successfully refactor a code.</p>
<p>I guess I have to practice on this ritual. Work - Stop - Pray - Review.</p>
