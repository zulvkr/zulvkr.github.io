People seems to love asking for portfolio so for now I just made this page. Sadly, no fancy GitHub API call yet.

I don't have any particular fullstack web app to be shared yet, but here is some things I made on my past time.

## Personal project

### Staticform.click

[Github link][1]

[website](https://staticform.click)

A website I made for people to make their own form buildder website with JAMStack. I played with tailwind and alpine.js write little documentation.

This project goes unpublished since I don't want people unknowingly share their whatsapp number / API key freely in GitHub repo if they left it as public repo. I still feel there is a way to make this project more useful.


### Discord bot

[Discord bot GitHub][2]

A discord bot in progress. I and some friends make it as a side project in our Bootcamp.

### Yajmaa

[Github link](https://github.com/zulvkr/yajmaa)

[website](https://yajmaa.netlify.app/)


An unfinished CRUD git based web app that I started with the simplest stack possible: Static site generator, vanilla js and Bulma CSS to iterate as fast as possible.

Along the way I decided to add Vue.js, gulp, sharp, babel, sass, \[add, more\]. In the end, my initial decision to use a simple known stack became a burden and the complexity of this project was getting higher due to the unusual stack. I want to spare my brain cells from this torture so it's abandoned now.


## Courses project

### Fullstack JS bootcamps bite sized project

This part is projects I made for the sake of completion of JS Fullstack Bootcamp from Flavio Copes. I explored some of the projects further, nonetheless, these projects are rather simple, but it reflects some bits of understanding of each technology.

- [REST API][3]

REST API with mongodb and express little project on JS fullstack bootcamp. My first iteration with actual REST API, finally

- [React - Github Users][4]

A client side react consuming GitHub REST API. Just a boring one. 

- [GitHub GraphQL API][5]

A client side JS + Express consuming GitHub GraphQL API. Alright, this is my first time fetching GraphQL.

- [Twitter Clone][6]

A messaging boards made with Redis and express. This is my first exposure with redis. Pretty neat.

- [Airtable shop][7]

Consuming airtable API. Just that.

- [Next RSS reader][8]

RSS reader made with Next.js. I just copied most of my Instructor code, but due to Next.js version just incremented to 11, I need to fix some parts. I love this Next.js. 


### PHP & MYSQL Ninja Course Project

[GitHub Link](https://github.com/zulvkr/learnphp)

This is the most complete complex project that I attended to. It's based on [a book from Sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/php-mysql-novice-to-ninja-6th-edition). The entire book is one big project of CRUD app made with vanilla PHP, no library.

It's quite hard to finish this course, zero library... man... I am a confused ninja now. I learned a lot and I gain some appreciation of Object oriented PHP with PSR-3. I also learned some SQL querying which is very useful.

PHP sure has changed and gained some static typing ability, but I still felt that PHP as a language is harder to learn correctly.

### Laravel

[GitHub Link](https://github.com/zulvkr/lvl-example)

This is a project based on traversy media "Laravel Crash Course" video. I found Laravel is amazing. So much magic that helps you iterate faster! The ORM is OK and many people praise it to the sky. It's PHP though ðŸ˜ž.

### Django

[GitHub Link](https://github.com/zulvkr/django-tutorial)

This is my take on django official tutorial. And my first python project. Still in progress..
