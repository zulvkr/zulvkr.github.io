After a few hours editing. I see my blog home in utter disgust. Sometimes the more you do thungs, the more you make a mess of it.

There are several point of critics:

### Where is the focus?

I couldn't help my self get distracted by big eye catching words and image in the left when I read the right side. The color has to be toned down to allow it to go to the background.

### Why so many asymmetrical empty space

The asymmetry must be balanced out with other item.

### The Big Java is annoying

It reminded me of banner that blotting the sky. It must be taken down.

### Why is there 2 Hi like paragraph?

I have 2 paragraph which describe 1. my blog, 2. myself. Which are overwhelming.

### The good part

I actually like how the paragraphs and each post are organized. Typographically aesthetic.

### A few minutes later

Actually, after evaluating eiwing my own design, I feel more confident in deleting some things taht are unnecessary to the blog. It's awesome feeling you get liken when you refactor some codes. I guess I have to practice this work - stop - review workflow to get more productive.
