Until 4 months ago, I was stuck in an odd job for a pharmacist. I didn't like my job. The routine felt gruelling and creating a report felt dull. Yet the dull job keeps increasing in number to the point drowning. The fact that my colleague did better than me at this dull job even when I tried my best is saddening.

Maybe it's not the job that is dull, maybe it's me that is biased to my dull routinity. I want improvement, yet I don't have the energy to pull it off. Hence I'm stuck.

Yet I'm afraid.

Coding is a hobby to me. But doing a coding job is... I'm afraid it will go outside of my expectations.

## My State of Portfolio

My portfolio was made of some half finished static websites that I made with some bad security idea in mind, thus it goes unpublished. But it's fine, it displays my markup skill a bit.

I don't have a working server right now. I think it's time to stop being stingy and start a good project with VPS. Next.js is a good choice now.

I haven't made the final PDF yet. I want to have a good one without hassle and portable enough, so I guess it will be Google Docs. I need it badly for applying so by the time anyone see this writing, it's already available.

My state of basic coding skill, I think I'm not a noob, but far from experienced. My skill is much better than most people in [flavio bootcamp](https://thejsbootcamp.com/) I think, or maybe I'm arrogant and delusional. Of course there are some experienced programmers in flavio bootcamp that took the course to update their skill. There's actually [a dude who recreated Node.js http module in TypeScript](https://github.com/dmitryt/tiny-web-server). Oh man, why are you in a beginner class?

Well, I just finished with FreeCodeCamp certification so that could speak up a bit for my skill.

## Prep stage, Let's strategize!

Jobs are everywhere, but that makes finding a good one can be harder. I think this is my current Issue. I have to make a strategy to apply efficiently and avoid potholes.

Let's filter the job now.

1. It should be local or have a local presence. A foreign one is fine but must have a solid background.
2. It should take a junior, 2 year experience, maybe a signal for junior or some kind.
3. It's not a pothole.
4. It aligns with my skill set and development program - backend.

This is just a random list I made, but surely it can be worked on as a base.

The first and second are easy to identify so I skipped that.

Number 4, since I want to be a backend guy, my focus should be looking for a full stack dev position with node js backend or PHP which I already understand well. PHP is not very tasty now and I'm rusty, so I left out with JavaScript backend. That's quite specific.

Number 3, I don't know.

Here are some idea:

1. Google all jobs and it's company, make a database and filter them properly.
2. It should be filtered by:
   1. It has actual working application
   2. It has good presence on internet
   3. Some people work in it Linked In
   4. Some open source presence -- hard
   5. It doesn't have any bad presence

Little I can do to avoid the pothole so I must pray for the best.

--- PRAYING ---

Alright, now here is the step I will take.

1. Make a portfolio in pdf
2. Collect as much information from telegrams for jobs.
3. Collect them from various job listings.
4. Tabulate the data and send them my application!

Some precaution needs to be made. Number 2 and number 3 can take forever to do so limit it by hours. 2 hours at best.

Alright, now before I finish my article, I will present to you [my PDF][1] and [web version][2] of my resume.

## What I actually do to get a Job

After lots of strategy building, I tried my best to stick to the strategy when doing it. But after creating the portfolio and PDF, I realized that applying for a job is actually a very low effort action. At this age, applying is as simple as clicking a button. I still tried to give some personal touch to my email if the job is interesting.

So the strategy becomes “apply to everywhere that needs a junior Web Engineer”, but avoid the sketchy one. As simple as that. In a week I applied to 10 or so jobs in glints and some other channel. They got some reception and I managed to get a job in a fairly nice startup with a nice offer.

The kind of sketchy job that I found when applying:

1. The job wants you to work right away without filtering the candidates. I don't have a great portfolio, yet that kind of job is desperate to get me, without a test or anything. It's madness.
2. Very lowball offer.

## Conclusion

My journey to get a job this time is pretty plain and flat without any surprise, which is good. I finally can say "look mum, I get a job from my hobby".
