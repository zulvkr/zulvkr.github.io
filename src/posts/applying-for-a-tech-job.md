There surely must be a way for me to stop learning React and start applying for an actual job where it matters. I don't like job in general, you know it. I love helping people but doing a job is... Often it went outside of your expectation. I love coding and messing with things, but I possibly can't do that in actual job.

But that's only a possibility. I may actually score an awesome job! So let's try my best doing this in a structured manner that actually works and don't render my heart too much due to rejection.

### My State of Portfolio

My portfolio is made of some half finished static websites that I made with with some bad security idea in mind, thus it goes unpublished. But it's fine, and displaying my markup skill a bit.

I don't have any working server right now. I think it's time to stop being stingy and start a good project with VPS. Next.js is worth it and very fine technology right now.

I haven't made the final PDF yet. I want to have a good one without hassle and portable enough, so I guess it will be Google Docs. I need it badly for applying so by the time anyone see this writing, it's already available.

My state of basic coding skill, I think I'm not a noob, but far from experienced. My skill much better than most people in [flavio bootcamp](https://thejsbootcamp.com/) I think, or maybe I'm arrogant delusional. Of course there are some experienced programmer in flavio bootcamp that took the course to update their skill. There's actually [a dude who recreated Node.js http module in TypeScript](https://github.com/dmitryt/tiny-web-server). Oh man, why are you in a beginner class.

Well, I just finished with FreeCodeCamp certification so that could speak up a bit for my skill.

### Have you look up jobs?

Jobs are everywhere, but that makes finding a good one can be harder. I think this is my current Issue. I have to make a strategy to apply efficiently and avoiding potholes.

Let's filter the job now.

1. It should be local or has local presence. A foreign one is fine but must have solid background.
2. It should take a junior, 2 year experience kind.
3. It's not a pothole.
4. It aligns with my skillset and development program - backend.

This is just a random list I made, but surely can be worked on as a base for specifying wanted job.

The first and second is easy to identify so I skipped on that.

Number 4, since I want to be a backend guy, my focus should be looking for a full stack dev position with node js backend or PHP which I already understand well. PHP is not very tasty now and I'm rusty, so I left out with JavaScript backend. That's quite specific.

Number 3, I don't know.

Here are some idea:

1. Google all job and it's company, make a database and filter them properly.
2. It should be filtered by:
   1. It has actual working application
   2. It has good presence on internet
   3. Some people work in it Linked In
   4. Some open source presence -- hard
   5. It doesn't have any bad presence

Little I can do to avoid pot hole so I must pray for the best.

Alright, now here is the step I will take.

1. Make a portfolio in pdf
2. Collect as much as information from telegram for job.
3. Collect them from various job listing, flavio, nocsok and one remote web job.
4. Tabulate the data and send!

Some precaution need to be made. Number 2 and number 3 can take forever to do so limit it by hours. 2 hours at best.

Alright, now before i finish my article, I will present you [my PDF][1] and [web version][2] of resume.

--- PRAYING ---

> One of my favorite prayer in this situation is Istikahara, you could look it up.

Now my resume is perfect, it's time to set out for the 2nd and 3rd step.

This will be the end of my article, see you!
